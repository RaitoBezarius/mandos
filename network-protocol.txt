The Mandos server announces itself as a Zeroconf service of type
"_mandos._tcp". The Mandos client sends a line of text where the first
whitespace-separated field is the protocol version, which currently is
"1".  The client and server then start a TLS protocol handshake with a
slight quirk: the Mandos server program acts as a TLS "client" while
the connecting Mandos client acts as a TLS "server".  The Mandos
client must supply an OpenPGP certificate, and the fingerprint of this
certificate is used by the Mandos server to look up (in a list read
from a file at start time) which binary blob to give the client.  No
other authentication or authorization is done by the server.
