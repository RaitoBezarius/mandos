  This is part of the Mandos system for allowing host computers to
  have encrypted root file systems and also be capable of remote and
  unattended reboots.  The host computers run a small client program
  in the initial RAM disk environment which will communicate with a
  server over a network.  The clients are identified by the server
  using a OpenPGP key; each client has one unique to it.  The server
  sends the clients an encrypted password.  The encrypted password is
  decrypted by the clients using the same OpenPGP key, and the
  password is then used to unlock the root file system, whereupon the
  host computers can continue booting normally.
