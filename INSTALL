* Prerequisites
  
** Operating System
   
   Debian 5.0 "lenny" or Ubuntu 8.04 "Hardy Heron".
   
   This is mostly for the support scripts which make sure that the
   client is installed and started in the initial RAM disk environment
   and that the initrd.img file is automatically made unreadable.  The
   server and client programs themselves *could* be run in other
   distributions, but they *are* specific to GNU/Linux systems, and
   are not intended to be portable to other Unixes.
  
** Libraries
   
   The following libraries and packages are needed.  (It is possible
   that it might work with older versions of some of these, but these
   versions are confirmed to work.  Newer versions are almost
   certainly OK.)
   
*** Documentation
    These are required to build the manual pages for both the server
    and client:
    
    + DocBook 4.5         http://www.docbook.org/
      Note: DocBook 5.0 is not compatible.
    + DocBook XSL stylesheets 1.71.0
                   http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookXslStylesheets
    
    Package names:
    docbook docbook-xsl
    
    To build just the documentation, run the command "make doc".  Then
    the manual page "mandos.8", for example, can be read by running
    "man -l mandos.8".
   
*** Mandos Server
    + GnuTLS 2.4          http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/
    + Avahi 0.6.16        http://www.avahi.org/
    + Python 2.4          http://www.python.org/
    + Python-GnuTLS 1.1.5 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gnutls/
    + dbus-python 0.82.4  http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/
    + python-ctypes 1.0.0 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ctypes
    
    Strongly recommended:
    + fping 2.4b2-to-ipv6 http://www.fping.com/
    
    Package names:
    python-gnutls avahi-daemon python python-avahi python-dbus
    python-ctypes
   
*** Mandos Client
    + initramfs-tools 0.85i
                  http://packages.qa.debian.org/i/initramfs-tools.html
    + GnuTLS 2.4          http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/
    + Avahi 0.6.16        http://www.avahi.org/
    + GnuPG 1.4.9         http://www.gnupg.org/
    + GPGME 1.1.6         http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/
    
    Package names:
    initramfs-tools libgnutls-dev libavahi-core-dev gnupg
    libgpgme11-dev

* Installing the Mandos server
  
  1. Do "make doc".
  
  2. On the computer to run as a Mandos server, run the following
     command:
     For Debian: su -c 'make install-server'
     For Ubuntu: sudo make install-server
     
     (This creates a configuration without any clients configured; you
     need an actually configured client to do that; see below.)

* Installing the Mandos client.
  
  1. Do "make all doc".
  
  2. On the computer to run as a Mandos client, run the following
     command:
     For Debian: su -c 'make install-client'
     For Ubuntu: sudo make install-client
     
     This will also create an OpenPGP key, which will take some time
     and entropy, so be patient.
  
  3. Run the following command:
     For Debian: su -c 'mandos-keygen --password'
     For Ubuntu: sudo mandos-keygen --password
     
     When prompted, enter the password/passphrase for the encrypted
     root file system on this client computer.  The command will
     output a section of text, starting with a [section header].  Copy
     and append this to the file "/etc/mandos/clients.conf" *on the
     server computer*.
  
  4. Configure the client to use the correct network interface.  The
     default is "eth0", and if this needs to be adjusted, it will be
     necessary to edit /etc/mandos/plugin-runner.conf to uncomment and
     change the line there.  If that file is changed, the initrd.img
     file must be updated, possibly using the following command:
     
	# update-initramfs -k all -u
  
  5. On the server computer, start the server by running the command
     For Debian: su -c 'invoke-rc.d mandos start'
     For Ubuntu: sudo invoke-rc.d mandos start
     
     At this point, it is possible to verify that the correct password
     will be received by the client by running the command:
     
	# /usr/lib/mandos/plugins.d/mandos-client \
		--pubkey=/etc/keys/mandos/pubkey.txt \
		--seckey=/etc/keys/mandos/seckey.txt; echo
     
     This command should retrieve the password from the server,
     decrypt it, and output it to standard output.
     
     After this, the client computer should be able to reboot without
     needing a password entered on the console, as long as it does not
     take more than an hour to reboot.

* Further customizations
  
  You may want to tighten or loosen the timeouts in the server
  configuration files; see mandos.conf(5) and mandos-clients.conf(5).
  If IPsec is not used, it is suggested that a more cryptographically
  secure checker program is used and configured, since without IPsec
  ping packets can be faked.
