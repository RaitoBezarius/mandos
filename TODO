* [#A] README file

* Plugin-runner
** [#A] Free plugin name and args
   [[file:plugin-runner.c::free%20plugin_list][file:plugin-runner.c::free plugin_list]] (both places)
** [#A] Change syntax for arguments
** [#B] Add more comments to code
** [#B] Add more if(debug) calls
** [#B] Seperate more code to function for more readability
** [#B] Make free_plugin_list() function
** [#A] Man page: man8/plugin-runner.8mandos
*** DESCRIPTION
    Describe the plus sign syntax for passing options from crypttab
*** EXIT STATUS
    Text needed
*** EXAMPLES
    Examples of normal usage, debug usage, debugging single or all
    plugins, examples of crypttab lines with plus syntax, etc.
*** FILES
    Text needed
*** SECURITY
    Text needed
*** NOTES
    Text needed
*** BUGS
    Text needed
*** SEE ALSO
    Explaining test on what you can read
** Support in configuration file for environment variables
** Keydir move: /etc/mandos -> /etc/keys/mandos
   Must create in preinst if not pre-depending on cryptsetup

* Password-request
** [#A] Man page: man8/password-request.8mandos
** Make prompt exactly like the normal prompt
   Use environment variables:
   "Enter passphrase to unlock the disk $cryptsource ($crypttarget): "
   [[file:plugins.d/password-prompt.c::fprintf%20stderr%20s%20Password%20prefix][Here]]
** [#B] Temporarily lower kernel log level
   for less printouts during sucessfull boot.
*** DESCRIPTION
    Move options to new OPTIONS section.
    State that this command is not meant to be invoked directly, but
    is run as a plugin from mandos-client(8) and only run in the
    initrd environment, not the real system.
*** EXIT STATUS
    Create this section
*** EXAMPLES
    Examples of normal usage, debug usage, debugging by connecting
    directly, etc.
*** FILES
    Describe the key files and the key ring files.  Also note that
    they should normally have been automatically created.
*** DIAGNOSTICS
    Create this section
*** SECURITY
    Create this section
*** NOTES
    Create this section (if needed)
*** BUGS
    Create this section
*** SEE ALSO
    Refer to mandos-client(8mandos) and password-prompt(8mandos)
** IPv4 support
** use strsep instead of strtok?
** Do not depend on GnuPG key rings on disk
   This would mean creating new GnuPG key rings with GPGME by
   importing the key files from scratch on every program start.

* Password-prompt
** [#A] Man page: man8/password-prompt.8mandos
** Show getenv("cryptsource") and getenv("crypttarget") if set
   cryptsource will be the device, like "/dev/sda3", and crypttarget
   will be the device mapper name, like "sda3_crypt".
*** DESCRIPTION
    Move options to new OPTIONS section.
*** EXIT STATUS
    Create this section
*** EXAMPLES
    Examples of normal usage, debug usage, with a prefix, etc.
*** DIAGNOSTICS
    Create this section
*** SECURITY
    Create this section
    Not much to do here but it is noteworthy to state the danger of
    not having a fallback option.
*** NOTES
    Note that this is more or less a simple getpass(3) wrapper, even
    though actual use of getpass(3) is not guaranteed.
*** BUGS
    Create this section
*** SEE ALSO
    Refer to mandos-client(8mandos) and password-request(8mandos)
** Use getpass(3)?
   Man page says "obsolete", but [[info:libc:getpass][GNU LibC Manual: Reading Passwords]]
   does not.  See also [[http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2003-05/msg00251.html][Marcus Brinkmann: Re: getpass obsolete?]] and
   [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.glibc.alpha/4906][Petter Reinholdtsen: Re: getpass obsolete?]], and especially also
   [[http://www.steve.org.uk/Reference/Unix/faq_4.html#SEC48][Unix Programming FAQ 3.1 How can I make my program not echo input?]]
** Replace completely with "/lib/cryptsetup/askpass"?

* Mandos (server)
** [#A] Command man page: man8/mandos.8
*** DESCRIPTION
    Move options to new OPTIONS section
*** EXIT STATUS
    Create this section
*** EXAMPLES
    Create this section
*** FILES
    Describe briefly that the server gets global settings from
    mandos.conf and clients from clients.conf, but refer to their man
    pages for more details.
*** DIAGNOSTICS

*** SECURITY

*** NOTES

*** BUGS

** Log level
** /etc/mandos/clients.d/*.conf
   Watch this directory and add/remove/update clients?
** config for TXT record
** Run-time communication with server
   Probably using D-Bus
   See also [[*Mandos-tools]]
** Implement --foreground
   [[info:standards:Option%20Table][Table of Long Options]]
** Implement --socket
   [[info:standards:Option%20Table][Table of Long Options]]
** Date+time on console log messages
   Is this the default?

* Mandos-tools/utilities
  All of this probably using D-Bus
** List clients
** Disable client
** Enable client

* Installer
** Client
*** DONE [#A] Change initrd.img file to not be publically readable
    /usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf-hooks.d/mandos
    UMASK=027
*** Update initrd.img after installation
** Server
*** [#A] Create mandos user and group for server
*** [#A] Create /var/run/mandos directory with perm and ownership

** mandos-keygen
*** [#A] Command man page: man8/mandos-keygen.8
*** [#A] Output cut-and-paste ready snippet for clients.conf.

* [#A] Package
** /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/mandos
*** Do not install in initrd.img if configured not to
    Use "/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/mandos"?  Definitely a debconf
    question.
** /etc/bash_completion.d/mandos
*** From xml sources directly?
** unperish
