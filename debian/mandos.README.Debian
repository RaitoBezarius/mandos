The Mandos server is useless without at least one configured client in
/etc/mandos/clients.conf.  To create one, install the "mandos-client"
package on a client computer, and run "mandos-keygen --password" there
to get a config file stanza.  Append that to /etc/mandos/clients.conf
on the Mandos server.
