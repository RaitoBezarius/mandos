A client key has been automatically created in /etc/keys/mandos.  The
next step is to run "mandos-keygen --password" to get a config file
stanza to copy and paste into /etc/mandos/clients.conf on the Mandos
server.

It is NOT necessary to edit /etc/crypttab to specify
/usr/lib/mandos/plugin-runner as a keyscript for the root file system;
if no keyscript is given for the root file system, the Mandos client
will be the new default way for getting a password for the root file
system when booting.
