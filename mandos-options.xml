  <para id="interface">
    If this is specified, the server will only announce the service
    and listen to requests on network interface
    <replaceable>IF</replaceable>.  Default is to use all available
    interfaces.  <emphasis>Note:</emphasis> a failure to bind to the
    specified interface is not considered critical, and the server
    does not exit.
  </para>
  
  <para id="address">
    If this option is used, the server will only listen to a specific
    address.  If a link-local address is specified, an interface
    should be set, since a link-local address is only valid on a
    single interface.  By default, the server will listen to all
    available addresses.  Also, this must currently be an IPv6
    address; an IPv4 address can only be specified using the
    <quote><systemitem class="ipaddress">::FFFF:192.0.2.3</systemitem
    ></quote> format.
  </para>
  
  <para id="port">
    If this option is used, the server will bind to that port. By
    default, the server will listen to an arbitrary port given by the
    operating system.
  </para>
  
  <para id="debug">
    If the server is run in debug mode, it will run in the foreground
    and print a lot of debugging information.  The default is
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> to run in debug mode.
  </para>
  
  <para id="priority">
    GnuTLS priority string for the TLS handshake with the clients.
    The default is
    <quote><literal>SECURE256:!CTYPE-X.509:+CTYPE-OPENPGP</literal></quote>.
    See <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gnutls_priority_init
    </refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> for the
    syntax.  <emphasis>Warning</emphasis>: changing this may make the
    TLS handshake fail, making communication with clients impossible.
  </para>
  
  <para id="servicename">
    Zeroconf service name.  The default is
    <quote><literal>Mandos</literal></quote>.  This only needs to be
    changed this if it, for some reason, is necessary to run more than
    one server on the same <emphasis>host</emphasis>, which would not
    normally be useful.  If there are name collisions on the same
    <emphasis>network</emphasis>, the newer server will automatically
    rename itself to <quote><literal>Mandos #2</literal></quote>, and
    so on; therefore, this option is not needed in that case.
