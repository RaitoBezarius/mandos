This NEWS file records noteworthy changes, very tersely.
See the manual for detailed information.

Version 1.0.3 (2009-01-06)
* Server
** Now tries to change to user and group "_mandos" before falling back
   to trying the old values "mandos", "nobody:nogroup", and "65534".
** Now does not abort on startup even if no clients are defined in
   clients.conf.

* Client
** Plugins named "*.dpkg-bak" are now ignored.
** Hopefully fixed compilation failure on some architectures where the
   C compiler does not recognize the "-z" option as a linker option.

Version 1.0.2 (2008-10-17)
* mandos-keygen now signs the encrypted key blobs.  This signature is
  not currently verified by mandos-client, but this may change in the
  future.

Version 1.0.1 (2008-10-07)
* Server
** Expand environment variables and ~user in clients.conf's "secfile"
   The "secfile" option in /etc/mandos/clients.conf now expands
   "~user/foo" and "$ENVVAR" strings.

* Client (plugin-runner, plugins, etc.)
** Manual pages for the usplash, splashy, and askpass-fifo plugins.
   All plugins now have man pages.
** More secure compilation and linking flags.
   All programs are now compiled with "-fstack-protector-all -fPIE
   -pie", and linked using "-z relro -pie" for additional security.

* There is now a "NEWS" file (this one), giving a history of
  noteworthy changes.
